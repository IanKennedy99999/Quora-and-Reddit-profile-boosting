# Quora-and-Reddit-profile-boosting

This Python script automates the process of upvoting posts on Quora and Reddit using the Selenium library.

Features
Quora Automation: Handles the process of signing in to Quora and upvoting posts.

Reddit Automation: Handles the process of signing in to Reddit and upvoting posts.

Usage
The script is meant to be run as a standalone Python program. Here are the main functions and how to use them:

quoraM(signIn=True): Handles the process of signing in to Quora (either with an existing account or a newly created one) and upvoting posts. Takes an optional boolean parameter signIn to determine whether to sign in with an existing account (signIn=True) or create a new account (signIn=False).

reddit(signIn=False, urls=[], num_upvotes=10): Similar to the quoraM function, this function handles signing in to Reddit and upvoting posts. It also takes an optional signIn parameter to determine whether to sign in with an existing account or create a new account. In addition, it takes an optional urls parameter, which is a list of URLs of Reddit user profiles to visit and upvote posts from, and an optional num_upvotes parameter, which is the number of posts to upvote per profile.

Before running the script, make sure that the Selenium library is installed, and the Chrome WebDriver is properly set up.

Installation
The script requires Python 3 and the Selenium library. You can install Selenium using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
You also need the Chrome WebDriver for Selenium. Please follow the official guide to set it up.
